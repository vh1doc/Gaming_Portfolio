# Gaming_Portfolio
This folder contains some of my most recent coding work from a game programming class I was in. We made some simple games in Unity2D and wrote scripts in C#. 
The scripts featured here were written for my final project, which was to create any original game of our own.

The game I created was titled: "Dog on a SpaceShip with a Gun", which is a pretty encompassing description of what it consisted of. 
I designed and drew the sprites and animations for the player (the walking animations were collectively almost 40 frames), and drew the background for it. 
The game's enemy sprites are animated as well, but I cannot take credit for the art for those, I outsourced them because of time constraints. 

There are a handful of features that I hope to add to this someday to make it more enjoyable (sound and multiple levels being the most significant),
but I'm proud of it as it is right now. I put a lot of time into this project.
